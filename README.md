# That's What's Up

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
It's a Saturday night, all of your assignments are completed and you just finished a 2-hour slog in the testing center. You finally meet up with your friends, but you end up spending the last 3 hours of the night trying to decide what to do. Enter 'That's What's Up'. With this website, users can find events happening in their area. Anyone can post about an event, and users will have the opportunity to save upcoming events for later. Each event has dates, details, and the number of users planning on attending. You'll never have to waste time trying to come up with something fun to do again.
